# bookmark_images

These images are 16px x 16px icons of the same design, with different fill colors. Their primary purpose is to be used with the [bookmark extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) in VScode to replace the default bookmark icon.

These icons are designed to model the bookmark icon found in Visual Studio 2017.
